In data_capture.py: I read ticker symbols from the Yahoo finance, then save them into local files, i.e. valid_labels, valid_prices.
parameters might be changed: startdate, stopdate, numberofprices.

In data_process.py: I randomly plot N stock markets and their labels, save to local .png image.two images, ...before... and ...after... shows the effect of normalization. 
Be cautious that some data are entirely 0s, which caused me some trouble when I normalize

With the help of pycluster, three metrics for both kmeans and kmedoids: 
euclidean ~30s 
spearman's R ~3-4min 
Kendall's tau ~10 - 15min . 

Note for kmeans, npass = 5, kmedoids npass=1
ncluster=10 for both.
